# Article quality

This tracker shows the changes to the Wikipedia article quality markers around `[[Category: Dalit]]` starting from the [Dalit History Month efforts](http://www.sucheta.net/whoseknowledge/dalit-history-month/process.pdf), starting April 2017.

By quality, we mean how the English-language Wikipedia's editors assess it - actual quality evaluations may or may not bear any resemblance to readers' realities. Categories are:

1. **FA** (Featured Article), an exceptional article
2. **GA** (Good Article), a good article
3. **B**, a solid article that is not quite at GA standard
4. **C**, an article that is more than basic but is lacking in key areas
5. **Start**, an article that covers the basics in all areas but needs to expand in all or most of them
6. **Stub**, a very short basic article.

Data covering the time before 28 July 2017 is slightly inaccurate because it cannot include articles that were deleted prior to that date.
